All code in this repository is free to anyone for non-commercial purposes. 
It is released under the creative commons license BY-NC.

It is written primarily in MATLAB and Python in the course of conducting 
scientific research in computational neuroscience, perception science, 
and psychology. 

Code comes "as is", and you use at your own risk. To my knowledge, there are 
no bugs in the code that would in any way affect the conclusions of the 
scientific articles I have published. Minor bugs or places where the code can
be improved will be noted in the comments. 

I am happy to answer questions, and can be reached at: cdimattina@fgcu.edu
