All code in this repository is free to anyone for non-commercial purposes. 
It is released under the creative commons license BY-NC.

It is written primarily in MATLAB and Python in the course of conducting 
scientific research in computational neuroscience, perception science, 
and psychology. 

Code comes "as is", and you use at your own risk. To my knowledge, there are 
no major bugs in the code that would affect any of the scientific studies I 
have published.
