All code in this repository is free to anyone for non-commercial purposes. 
It is written primarily in MATLAB and Python, and was written in the course
of conducting scientific research in computational neuroscience, perception
science, and psychology. 

Code comes "as is", and you use at your own risk.To my knowledge, there are 
no bugs in the code that would in any way affect the conclusions of the 
scientific articles I have published. I do point out a couple trivial bugs
(and provide fixes) in the original code where they occur. 

I am happy to answer questions, and can be reached at: cdimattina@fgcu.edu
